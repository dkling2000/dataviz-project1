We have found a listing of the Happiest cities in America as by ranked Wallethub.com.  What we are going to try to substantiate the listing by taking the top and bottom cities and use other factors:
        - Yelp Rating (Ben)
        - Weather (Krunal)
            - cloudy days vs. sunny days
        - Bars (Mike)
        - birth rate ?
        - marijuana legalized (Mike)
        - population density (Dave)
        - # of doctors per capita ?
        - population movement in and out of those cities (Dave).
Next steps is to find the datasets and start programming.
